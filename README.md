# Sorting Algorithms and Binary Search Trees

This project demonstrates the implementation of various sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and the creation of Binary Search Trees.

## Sorting Algorithms

The project includes three main sorting algorithms:

- **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm iterates over an array and constructs a sorted output list. Each element in the array is compared with the largest value in the sorted list. It is either left in place or inserted into the correct position within the sorted list.

- **Selection Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the first element.

- **Merge Sort**: This recursive algorithm continually splits a list in half. If the list has one or no item, it is already sorted. If there are more items, the list is split and a merge sort is recursively invoked on both halves. The two halves are then merged once sorted.

## Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all nodes adhere to a specific property: the left child is less than the parent node, and the right child is greater than the parent node. The project includes code that builds a binary search tree from a provided list of values.

## Instructions to Run

This project can be run by any Python3 interpreter. To execute it, clone the repository, navigate to the repository in your terminal, and run the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Requirements
